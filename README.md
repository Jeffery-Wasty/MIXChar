This project required students to create a program that would allow users to convert between a regular Unicode character and a MIXChar, the two being identical aside from the value assigned to them (https://imgur.com/a/RqB5h). The conversion used a key and methods were included to handle all types of conversions, toChar, toMIXChar, toString, etc. In additon, a string of characters can be encrypted as an array of unsigned long, and then decrypted with no loss.
